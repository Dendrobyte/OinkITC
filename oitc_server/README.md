# OinkITC Server

## Running the Server

Instructions on running this TBD. Will run on a dedicated instance.

## Contributing

I probably won't fill out development practices but in the off chance you have questions and/or want to fork this for anything- please reach out! @Mobkinz78 on Twitter or just via GitHub somehow?

I do have intentions to expand upon this since ultimately I want to make a multiplayer game, and it would be nice to have a server that works for more than just one game. For now it's small-ish projects to get my ball rolling.
